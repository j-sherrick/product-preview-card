### 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Sass to organize and manage CSS in a modular way. I also improved my understanding of responsive design, ensuring the component looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. My goal was to adhere closely to a BEM architecture, using a combination of both nested and flat approaches to structuring my directories and source files. This combination made the most sense to me and helped streamline the project's organization.

### 🌱 Continued Growth

- Continue to explore 'vanilla' architectures for structuring learning projects.
- Improve my writing and documentation skills.
