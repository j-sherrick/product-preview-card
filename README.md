## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

My personal goals:

- Complete the challenge 'vanilla'.
- Improve my Sass and overall CSS skills.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM architecture
- Sass

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Sass to organize and manage CSS in a modular way. I also improved my understanding of responsive design, ensuring the component looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. My goal was to adhere closely to a BEM architecture, using a combination of both nested and flat approaches to structuring my directories and source files. This combination made the most sense to me and helped streamline the project's organization.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

- Continue to explore 'vanilla' architectures for structuring learning projects.
- Improve my writing and documentation skills.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)
- [Structure of BEM Projects](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/) - The key takeaway for me is, use the approach that works best for _your_ project.
